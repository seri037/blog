Hello everyone in KDE community!

I'm Chengkun Chen, and my nicknames are usually "seri037" or "seri%". This year I'll be responsible for improving subtitle support in Kdenlive and I'm excited to work with all of you. :)

### About Project

The subtitle support in Kdenlive is limited due to its current storage method: subtitles are stored in [SRT format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) files, which are human-readable but lack flexibility. The [ASS format](http://www.tcax.org/docs/ass-specs.htm) is a better choice to enhance Kdenlive's creative capabilities. This project will focus on migrating Kdenlive from a subtitle storage system centered around the SRT format to one centered around the ASS format. **The expected result is more diverse and rich subtitle effects, such as karaoke, along with a more powerful subtitle editor.**

### About me
I am a second-year undergraduate student in China, majoring Software Enginneering. My goal is to write code that people around the world can freely use, making life more convenient. Additionally, I am a producer and video creator, and I have been using Kdenlive for about two to three years. This is my first time paticipating in an open-source project and I feel very fortunate to have been selected. I'm looking forward to gaining new experiences from improving Kdenlive with the great Kdenlive team. Welcome to check my progress on [my blog](https://seri037.github.io/blog/) and connect with me.

Thanks for your reading! Stay tuned-
