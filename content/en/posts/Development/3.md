Hi there! The past few weeks have been really busy with my final exams, so I had to slow down my work. Here’s a brief status report on my progress over the past 4 weeks:

I created a SubtitleEvent class to help us better manage subtitle event information, which can replace the original SubtitledTime class. To distinguish subtitles from different layers, I also added basic display support for subtitle layers as multiple subtitle tracks.

Currently, I’m focused on refining these features. There are still some minor tasks to complete and bugs to fix. You can find more information at [this MR](https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/kdenlive/-/merge_requests/522).

Stay tuned!
